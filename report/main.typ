The purpose of the final report is to present your ideas, algorithms, implementation,
and experiences—what worked and what didn’t.
It should again follow the narrative arc outlined in the research catechism and include the following sections:

1. Introduction and precise problem statement.
2. Overview of your approach and a summary of how it relates to previous work.
3. Algorithms and Logical Encodings you developed.
4. Summary of Results, including
  key design and implementation challenges;
  how you addressed them (what worked, what didn’t, and why);
  and how this work could lead to a real tool or a full-length conference paper.
5. Teamwork: a one-paragraph description of the individual team member’s contributions.
6. Course Topics: a one-paragraph description of the course topics applied in the project,
  and a one-paragraph description (if applicable) of any topics that would have been useful but weren’t covered in the course.


The report should be 5 pages long (excluding references).
Keep your writing brief and precise.
Illustrate algorithms and encodings with examples and figures.
Illustrate results with tables, graphs, and screenshots.
Submit the report in PDF format by the due date.
The final submission should also include your demo slides and a ZIP archive with the source code for the tool,
build scripts, benchmarks (if applicable), and a README file describing how to run the tool on your end-to-end scenarios.
